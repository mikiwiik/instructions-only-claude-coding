# IPL-071: Implement Issue Prompt Log (IPL) documentation system

## Issue Context

**GitHub Issue:** #71
**Issue Type:** feature
**Priority:** priority-3-medium
**Complexity:** complexity-simple

## Before Implementation

### Initial User Request

```text
That sounds like a very good idea! Let's keep the implementation minimal. The point: the capture the prompts in the issue context: before, during and after implementation. Please create an issue for taking it into use
```

### Problem Context

After discussing the concept of Issue Prompt Logs (IPLs) as a way to document the conversational evolution
of requirements in instruction-only development, the user approved the idea and requested implementation.
The goal was to create a minimal system that captures prompts in the context of GitHub issues throughout
the development lifecycle.

## During Implementation

### Key Clarifying Questions

No significant clarifying questions were needed - the user provided clear direction to keep the implementation
minimal and focus on capturing prompts before, during, and after implementation.

### Requirement Refinements

- Confirmed minimal approach focusing on prompt capture rather than extensive analysis
- Established connection to instruction-only development methodology
- Decided to create template-based system matching ADR patterns
- Integrated with existing documentation structure

### Implementation Approach Discussion

- Followed established task planning protocol with TodoWrite
- Created directory structure mirroring ADR organization
- Designed simple template focusing on conversation evolution
- Created example IPL to demonstrate usage

## After Implementation

### Final Implementation Instructions

```text
let's start implementing #71. Make sure you're up to date with the latest main and claude.md
```

The user provided direct instruction to proceed with implementation after task planning approval.

### Lessons Learned

**Effective Instruction Patterns:**

- Clear approval after conceptual discussion ("That sounds like a very good idea!")
- Specific implementation guidance ("keep the implementation minimal")
- Direct purpose statement ("capture the prompts in the issue context")
- Clear action request ("create an issue for taking it into use")

**Areas for Improvement:**

- Could have included more examples in initial concept discussion
- Template could be expanded with more guidance sections

**Future Considerations:**

- IPLs should be created for significant issues going forward
- Template may need refinement based on usage patterns
- Integration with GitHub workflow could be enhanced
