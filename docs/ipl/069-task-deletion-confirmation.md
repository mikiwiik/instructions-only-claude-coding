# IPL-069: Add confirmation dialog for task deletion

## Issue Context

**GitHub Issue:** #69
**Issue Type:** enhancement
**Priority:** priority-2-high
**Complexity:** complexity-simple

## Before Implementation

### Initial User Request

```text
let's create an UX issue. I don't like that tasks can be deleted without confirmation => let's add a confirmation dialogue.
```

### Problem Context

User experienced poor UX where tasks could be accidentally deleted without any confirmation, leading to potential
data loss and user frustration. The request was for adding a confirmation dialog to prevent accidental deletions.

## During Implementation

### Key Clarifying Questions

**User clarification about relationship to other issues:**

```text
This is also related to #36, where I want to enable re-opening a task without additional dialogues, but prevent doing it accidentally
```

### Requirement Refinements

- Identified relationship to issue #36 (task re-opening functionality)
- Both issues focus on preventing accidental actions while maintaining good UX
- Confirmation dialog should be accessible and follow design system patterns
- Need to consider how this fits with overall task management UX improvements

### Implementation Approach Discussion

- Considered modal vs native browser confirm dialog
- Discussed accessibility requirements (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
- Emphasized following existing design patterns in the application
- Noted importance of clear warning about permanent deletion

## After Implementation

### Final Implementation Instructions

[To be completed when implementation occurs - this IPL was created as an example during IPL system implementation]

### Lessons Learned

**Effective Instruction Patterns:**

- Clear, direct problem statement ("I don't like that...")
- Immediate solution suggestion ("add a confirmation dialogue")
- Context provided about relationship to other issues

**Areas for Improvement:**

- Could have specified preferred dialog type (modal vs browser confirm)
- Could have mentioned specific accessibility requirements upfront

**Future Considerations:**

- This UX improvement should be coordinated with issue #36 implementation
- Consider creating a consistent pattern for confirmation dialogs across the app

## Related Issues

- #36 - Enable task re-opening (both focus on preventing accidental actions)
