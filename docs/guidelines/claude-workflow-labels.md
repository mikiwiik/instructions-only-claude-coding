2. **Agentic Coding Methodology** ‚öôÔ∏è
   - Process improvements for instruction-only development
   - Human-AI role definition and boundary clarification
   - Task planning protocols and methodologies
   - Quality assurance through AI implementation

3. **Claude Code Integration** üõ†Ô∏è
   - Claude Code environment configuration and setup
   - Tool integration and optimization issues
   - Development environment improvements for AI assistance

### Exclusions

**‚ùå Do NOT use claude-workflow for:**

- General development workflow (git, CI/CD, testing) - use standard labels
- Feature implementations or bug fixes - focus on the functionality, not the AI aspect
- UI/UX improvements - unless specifically about AI interaction patterns
- Infrastructure or deployment changes - unless related to Claude Code setup

## Integration with Other Labels

### Required Label Combinations

**All claude-workflow issues MUST include:**

- **Priority label**: priority-1-critical through priority-4-low
- **Complexity label**: complexity-minimal through complexity-epic

### Common Label Patterns

#### High-Priority AI Workflow Issues

```bash
--label "claude-workflow,priority-1-critical,complexity-simple"
```

**Use for:** Urgent AI collaboration blockers or critical instruction improvements

#### Documentation and Guidelines

```bash
--label "claude-workflow,documentation,priority-2-high,complexity-simple"
```

**Use for:** AI collaboration documentation that needs immediate attention

#### Process Improvements

```bash
--label "claude-workflow,process-improvement,priority-2-high,complexity-moderate"
```

**Use for:** Comprehensive workflow enhancements for AI collaboration

#### Configuration and Setup

```bash
--label "claude-workflow,enhancement,priority-3-medium,complexity-simple"
```

**Use for:** Tool configuration and environment optimization

### Integration Guidelines

1. **Priority Assessment**: claude-workflow issues should be prioritized based on their impact on AI collaboration effectiveness
2. **Complexity Estimation**: Consider both technical complexity and the need for methodology understanding
3. **Additional Labels**: Combine with standard labels (documentation, enhancement, process-improvement) as appropriate

## Best Practices
