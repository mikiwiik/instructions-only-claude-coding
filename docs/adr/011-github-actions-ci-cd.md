# ADR-011: GitHub Actions for CI/CD Pipeline

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Todo App project needs a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to:

- Automatically build the application on every push and pull request
- Ensure code changes compile successfully before integration
- Run tests and linting to maintain code quality
- Provide fast feedback to developers on build status
- Enable automated deployment in the future

Key constraints and considerations:
- Project is hosted on GitHub
- Team familiarity with GitHub ecosystem is important
- Need integration with existing GitHub Issues workflow
- Budget considerations (free tier requirements)
- Learning curve should be minimal for educational project
- Must support Node.js/Next.js build process

## Decision

We will use **GitHub Actions** as our CI/CD platform for the following workflow:
- Build pipeline triggered on push to main and all pull requests
- Node.js matrix strategy testing versions 18.x and 20.x (LTS)
- Multi-OS testing (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)
- npm dependency caching for performance
- Build artifact storage for potential deployment use

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Native GitHub Integration**: Seamless integration with existing GitHub repository and Issues workflow
- **Zero Setup Cost**: Included in GitHub free tier with generous usage limits
- **Familiar Environment**: Same platform as code hosting, reducing learning curve
- **Rich Ecosystem**: Large marketplace of pre-built actions
- **YAML Configuration**: Simple, version-controlled workflow definitions
- **Matrix Builds**: Easy testing across multiple Node.js versions and operating systems
- **Status Integration**: Build status automatically appears in PRs and commit history

### Negative

- **Platform Lock-in**: Tied to GitHub ecosystem, migration would require workflow rewrite
- **Limited Advanced Features**: Fewer enterprise features compared to dedicated CI/CD platforms
- **GitHub Dependency**: Service availability tied to GitHub's uptime
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn GitHub Actions YAML syntax and concepts

### Neutral

- **Standard CI/CD Features**: Provides all necessary features for basic build pipeline
- **Community Support**: Large community but not specialized CI/CD focused
- **Documentation Quality**: Good but varies across different actions

## Alternatives Considered

- **GitLab CI**: Excellent CI/CD features but would require moving repository or mirroring
- **CircleCI**: Powerful platform but adds external dependency and potential cost
- **Jenkins**: Self-hosted flexibility but requires infrastructure management and maintenance
- **Vercel/Netlify**: Deployment-focused but limited CI capabilities for testing matrix
