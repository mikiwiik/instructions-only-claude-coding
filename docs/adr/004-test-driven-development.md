# ADR-004: Implement Test-Driven Development approach

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to establish a development methodology for building reliable, maintainable code. Key considerations:
- Code quality and bug prevention
- Development workflow and discipline
- Confidence in refactoring
- Documentation through tests
- Learning and skill development
- Project timeline and complexity

## Decision

Adopt Test-Driven Development (TDD) as our primary development methodology, writing tests before implementation code.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Higher code quality with fewer bugs in production
- Better code design through testability requirements
- Comprehensive test coverage by default
- Confidence when refactoring or adding features
- Tests serve as living documentation
- Forces clear thinking about requirements and interfaces
- Easier debugging and error isolation
- Better separation of concerns

### Negative
- Slower initial development pace
- Learning curve for developers new to TDD
- Requires discipline and process adherence
- Can lead to over-testing or testing implementation details
- May feel tedious for simple functionality

### Neutral
- Requires good testing framework and tooling setup
- Need to balance unit, integration, and e2e tests
- Team needs to agree on testing standards and practices

## Alternatives Considered

- **Test After Development**: Faster initially but often leads to poor coverage
- **No Testing**: Fastest development but highest risk and maintenance cost
- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**: Good for acceptance criteria but more complex
- **Property-Based Testing**: Excellent for finding edge cases but steeper learning curve
