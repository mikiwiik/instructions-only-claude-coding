# ADR-002: Choose TypeScript for type safety

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to decide whether to use JavaScript or TypeScript for our Todo application. Key considerations:

- Type safety and error prevention
- Developer experience and IDE support
- Code maintainability and refactoring
- Learning curve for team members
- Integration with React and testing frameworks

## Decision

Use TypeScript with strict type checking enabled for the entire codebase.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Compile-time error detection prevents runtime bugs
- Excellent IDE support with autocomplete and refactoring
- Better code documentation through type annotations
- Easier refactoring and code maintenance
- Improved developer productivity in medium-to-large codebases
- Great integration with React, Next.js, and testing tools
- Self-documenting code through interfaces and types

### Negative

- Initial learning curve for developers new to TypeScript
- Additional compilation step and tooling complexity
- More verbose code compared to plain JavaScript
- Potential over-engineering for simple components

### Neutral

- Industry standard for modern React applications
- Well-supported by Next.js out of the box
- Extensive community resources and documentation

## Alternatives Considered

- **Plain JavaScript**: Simpler but lacks type safety benefits
- **JavaScript with JSDoc**: Type annotations without compilation, but less robust
- **Flow**: Facebook's type system, but smaller ecosystem and declining adoption
