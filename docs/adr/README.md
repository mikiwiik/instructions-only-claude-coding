# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Todo App project.
ADRs document important architectural decisions, their context, and consequences.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are short text documents that capture important architectural
decisions made during the project development. They help maintain a clear history of technical choices
and their rationale.

## Naming Convention

See [PROCESS.md](PROCESS.md#naming-convention) for detailed naming convention guidelines.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

- **Title**: Brief description of the decision
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context**: Situation requiring a decision
- **Decision**: What was chosen
- **Consequences**: Positive and negative outcomes

## Creating New ADRs

1. Use the [template](template.md) as a starting point
2. Number the ADR sequentially (next available number)
3. Use descriptive kebab-case filename: `###-decision-title.md`
4. Follow the established format for consistency

## Process

**ðŸ“‹ Complete Process Documentation**: See [PROCESS.md](PROCESS.md) for detailed ADR requirements and guidelines.

- All major architectural decisions should be documented as ADRs
- ADRs should be created when making significant technical choices
- ADRs are immutable once accepted (create new ADR to supersede)
- All team members should review proposed ADRs before acceptance
