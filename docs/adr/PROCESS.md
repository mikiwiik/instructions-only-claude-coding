# Architecture Decision Records (ADR) Process

This document defines the mandatory process for creating and maintaining Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in this project.

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT

## ALL MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL CHANGES MUST BE DOCUMENTED AS ADRs

This is a non-negotiable requirement for maintaining project knowledge and ensuring informed decision-making.

## When to Create ADRs

Create an ADR whenever making decisions about:

### Technology and Framework Decisions

- **Framework and library choices** (React frameworks, UI libraries, state management)
- **Development tools** (build tools, linters, formatters, testing frameworks)
- **Third-party dependencies** (adding significant new libraries or services)
- **Language and runtime decisions** (TypeScript settings, Node.js versions)

### Architecture and Design Decisions

- **Architecture patterns** (component structure, data flow, API design)
- **Code organization** (folder structure, module boundaries, naming conventions)
- **State management strategies** (local vs global state, persistence approaches)
- **API design patterns** (REST vs GraphQL, request/response formats)

### Development and Operations Decisions

- **Development practices** (testing strategies, code review processes, deployment)
- **Security approaches** (authentication methods, data protection, access control)
- **Performance strategies** (optimization approaches, caching, bundling)
- **Database and storage decisions** (persistence strategies, data modeling)

## ADR Process

### 1. Before Implementation

- **Create ADR first**: Document the decision before writing code
- **Status "Proposed"**: Start with proposed status for review
- **Consider alternatives**: Research and document other options

### 2. Documentation Standards

- **Use template**: Always start with `docs/adr/template.md`
- **Sequential numbering**: Use next available number (###-title.md)
- **Descriptive titles**: Clear, specific titles in kebab-case
- **Complete context**: Explain why the decision is needed

### 3. Decision Process

- **Document alternatives**: List and evaluate other options considered
- **State decision clearly**: Be specific about what was chosen
- **Explain rationale**: Why this option was selected
- **List consequences**: Both positive and negative impacts

### 4. Finalization

- **Update status**: Change to "Accepted" when decision is final
- **Update index**: Add entry to `docs/adr/README.md` table
- **Reference in commits**: Link ADR in related git commits

## ADR Location and Naming

- **Directory**: `docs/adr/`
- **Template**: Use `docs/adr/template.md`
- **Naming**: `###-kebab-case-title.md` (e.g., `009-api-client-library.md`)
- **Numbering**: Sequential, starting from 001

## Example Scenarios Requiring ADRs

### Adding New Features

```markdown
# Before adding authentication

â†’ ADR: Authentication strategy (OAuth vs JWT vs sessions)

# Before adding animations

â†’ ADR: Animation library choice (Framer Motion vs React Spring vs CSS)

# Before adding forms

â†’ ADR: Form validation approach (Yup vs Zod vs React Hook Form)
```

### Changing Architecture

```markdown
# Before changing state management

â†’ ADR: Migration from hooks to Redux (why and how)

# Before adding API layer

â†’ ADR: API client architecture (fetch vs Axios vs SWR)

# Before restructuring files

â†’ ADR: File organization principles (feature-based vs type-based)
```

### Adding Dependencies

```markdown
# Before adding UI components

â†’ ADR: Component library choice (Headless UI vs Material-UI vs custom)

# Before adding date handling

â†’ ADR: Date library selection (date-fns vs dayjs vs native Date)

# Before adding testing utilities

â†’ ADR: Testing strategy evolution (unit vs integration focus)
```

## Quality Standards

### Required ADR Sections

- **Status**: Current state (Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded)
- **Context**: Situation requiring the decision
- **Decision**: What was chosen
- **Consequences**: Positive, negative, and neutral impacts
- **Alternatives**: Other options considered

### Optional but Recommended

- **References**: Links to documentation, discussions, research
- **Implementation notes**: Specific technical details
- **Migration path**: How to transition from previous approach

## Enforcement

### Automated Checks

- All commits introducing new dependencies must reference an ADR
- Architecture changes require ADR creation before code review
- Pull requests should link to relevant ADRs

### Review Process

- ADRs should be reviewed by team members before acceptance
- Consider consequences and alternatives during review
- Update status only after consensus

## Maintenance

### Updating ADRs

- ADRs are **immutable** once accepted
- Create new ADR to supersede previous decisions
- Update index when adding new ADRs
- Keep historical ADRs for reference

### Periodic Review

- Review ADRs during major project milestones
- Identify outdated decisions that need superseding
- Ensure ADR index stays current

**Remember**: The goal is to maintain clear documentation of _why_ decisions were made, not just
_what_ was decided. This enables informed future changes and helps new team members understand the
project's evolution.
