# Project Management and Issue Tracking

This document outlines the project management practices, issue tracking workflow, and planning methodologies
used in the Todo App project.

## Kanban-Style Continuous Delivery Workflow

The Todo App follows a **kanban-style workflow** with continuous, on-demand releases. There are no formal sprints or
scheduled releases‚Äîwork flows continuously from backlog to production.

### Core Workflow Principles

- **Continuous Flow**: Issues move through Todo ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Done
- **Work-in-Progress Limits**: Typically 1-2 issues actively being worked on at any time
- **On-Demand Releases**: Features are pushed to production immediately upon completion
- **Priority-Driven**: Next work is selected based on priority labels and complexity assessment
- **Just-in-Time Planning**: Issue selection and planning happens as current work completes

### Work-in-Progress (WIP) Management

**Typical WIP**: 1-2 issues at a time

**Benefits of Limited WIP**:

- **Focused effort**: Deep work on current tasks without context switching
- **Faster completion**: Issues move to Done faster with concentrated attention
- **Reduced complexity**: Simpler coordination and fewer merge conflicts
- **Clear priorities**: What's being worked on is always visible and intentional

**Exception scenarios**:

- Blocked issue: Start next priority while waiting for unblock
- Multi-agent work: Parallel implementation by specialized agents (frontend + testing)
- Quick fixes: Critical bugs may interrupt current work

### Issue Selection Process

**When current work completes**:

1. **Review completed work**: Ensure PR is merged and deployed
2. **Evaluate priorities**: Use `/select-next-issue` command or manual review
3. **Select next issue**: Choose based on:
   - Priority level (critical ‚Üí high ‚Üí medium ‚Üí low)
   - Complexity (prefer quick wins: high priority + simple/minimal complexity)
   - Dependencies (blocking issues take precedence)
   - Context switching costs (related work may be more efficient)
4. **Start implementation**: Move issue to "In Progress" and begin work

### Release Strategy

**Continuous Deployment**:

- **No release schedule**: Features deploy when ready
- **Immediate value**: Users get improvements as soon as they're completed
- **Small batches**: Individual features deployed independently
- **Rapid feedback**: Quick iteration based on real usage
- **Rollback ready**: Small changes are easier to revert if needed

**Deployment triggers**:

- PR merged to main branch
- All CI/CD checks passing
- Automated deployment to production (Vercel)

### Backlog Management

- **Priority Ordering**: Issues ordered by priority label (critical at top)
- **Complexity Assessment**: All issues labeled with complexity for informed selection
- **Continuous Grooming**: Priorities and complexity updated as understanding evolves
- **Dependency Tracking**: Blocking issues identified and prioritized appropriately
- **Quick Wins**: High-priority + simple-complexity issues highlighted for momentum

### Planning and Coordination

**No formal sprint planning**, but regular activities include:

- **Daily prioritization**: Quick review of what to work on next
- **Backlog grooming**: Update issue priorities and complexity as needed
- **Dependency management**: Identify and sequence blocking issues
- **Capacity awareness**: Consider complexity when selecting next work
- **Retrospective improvements**: Continuous process optimization based on experience

## Project Management Overview

The Todo App uses GitHub Issues for feature tracking and follows a structured development approach designed
to demonstrate professional project management practices while supporting the educational objectives of Claude
Code collaboration.

### Core Principles

- **Issue-Driven Development**: All features begin with detailed GitHub issues
- **Architectural Documentation**: Major decisions documented as ADRs in `docs/adr/`
- **Test-Driven Development**: TDD methodology for all feature implementation
- **Quality Assurance**: Pre-commit hooks ensure code quality with automatic linting and formatting
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Claude Code assistance integrated throughout development workflow

## Priority and Complexity System

**üìã Full Documentation**: See [`docs/reference/labels-and-priorities.md`](../reference/labels-and-priorities.md) for
comprehensive details on:

- **Priority Labels**: priority-1-critical through priority-4-low
- **Complexity Labels**: complexity-minimal through complexity-epic
- **Category Labels**: category-feature, category-infrastructure, category-documentation, category-dx
- **Assessment Guidelines**: Detailed criteria for assigning each label
- **Planning Matrix**: Strategic combinations (quick wins, major features, learning opportunities)

### Quick Reference

**Priority Labels** üî¥üü†üü°üü¢:

- **Critical**: Blocking issues, security, broken core functionality
- **High**: Important features, significant improvements, major bugs
- **Medium**: Standard features, minor improvements, non-critical bugs
- **Low**: Nice-to-have features, documentation, minor enhancements

**Complexity Labels** üü¢üîµüü°üü†üî¥:

- **Minimal**: Single file changes (15-30 minutes)
- **Simple**: Basic features, straightforward logic (1-3 hours)
- **Moderate**: Multi-component changes, state management (3-8 hours)
- **Complex**: Architecture changes, system design (1-3 days)
- **Epic**: Major overhauls, breaking changes (1+ weeks)

**Category Labels**:

- **Feature**: Core application functionality and user features
- **Infrastructure**: DevOps, CI/CD, testing infrastructure
- **Documentation**: ADRs, guides, technical writing
- **DX**: Developer experience, Claude Code workflows, tooling

### Strategic Issue Selection

**Quick Wins** (High Priority + Low Complexity):

- Immediate implementation for maximum impact
- Perfect for filling small time gaps
- Build momentum with visible progress

**Major Features** (High Priority + High Complexity):

- Requires detailed planning and architecture consideration
- May need breaking into smaller issues
- Allocate dedicated focused time

## Claude-Workflow Label Integration

**üìã Full Guidelines**: See [`docs/guidelines/claude-workflow-labels.md`](../guidelines/claude-workflow-labels.md)
for comprehensive usage and integration guidelines.

### When to Use claude-workflow Label

**‚úÖ Use for AI-related issues:**

- Claude Code usage and instruction improvements
- AI collaboration patterns and methodologies
- CLAUDE.md documentation and requirements
- Task planning protocols for agentic coding
- Issue creation and labeling processes for AI development

**‚ùå Standard development issues:**

- General git/CI/CD workflow (use standard labels)
- Feature implementations (focus on functionality)
- UI/UX improvements (unless AI interaction specific)

## Issue Management Workflow

## GitHub Projects Integration

### Overview

The project uses **GitHub Projects** to enhance the label-based issue management system with visual workflow
management, quick wins identification, and idea capture capabilities. Projects complements the existing
priority/complexity label system while maintaining labels as the primary source of truth.

**üìã Decision Documentation**: See [ADR-020: GitHub Projects Adoption](../adr/020-github-projects-adoption.md) for
full rationale and trade-offs.

**üîß Setup Guide**: See [GitHub Projects Setup Guide](github-projects-setup.md) for detailed configuration instructions.

### Custom Fields

GitHub Projects uses custom fields to provide structured data and filtering capabilities:

| Field          | Type          | Values                                            | Source                           |
| -------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Priority**   | Single Select | Critical, High, Medium, Low                       | Mapped from priority-\* labels   |
| **Complexity** | Single Select | Minimal, Simple, Moderate, Complex, Epic          | Mapped from complexity-\* labels |
| **Category**   | Single Select | Feature, Infrastructure, Documentation, DX        | Mapped from category-\* labels   |
| **Status**     | Single Select | Todo, In Progress, Review, Testing, Done, Blocked | Manual workflow tracking         |
| **Lifecycle**  | Single Select | Icebox, Backlog, Active, Done                     | Idea maturity stage              |

### Project Views

Five specialized views provide different perspectives on the work:

#### 1. Board View (Primary Workflow)

**Purpose**: Daily kanban workflow visualization

**Configuration**:

- Layout: Board (kanban)
- Columns: Status field (Todo ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Done)
- Grouping: Priority (horizontal swimlanes)
- Filter: `Lifecycle:Active OR Lifecycle:Backlog`

**Use Case**: See what's being worked on, move issues through workflow stages, identify bottlenecks

#### 2. Backlog View (Issue Selection)

**Purpose**: Select next issue to work on

**Configuration**:

- Layout: Table
- Columns: Title, Priority, Complexity, Category, Status, Lifecycle
- Sorting: Priority (Critical first), then Complexity (Simple first)
- Filter: `Lifecycle:Active OR Lifecycle:Backlog`

**Use Case**: Replacement/enhancement for `/select-next-issue` with sortable, filterable table view

#### 3. Quick Wins View (Momentum)

**Purpose**: Identify high-impact, low-effort tasks

**Configuration**:

- Layout: Board
- Columns: Status
- Filter: `Priority:High AND (Complexity:Simple OR Complexity:Minimal) AND Lifecycle:Active`

**Use Case**: Find quick wins to build momentum between larger features

#### 4. Agent Workload View (Coordination)

**Purpose**: Visualize multi-agent work distribution

**Configuration**:

- Layout: Board
- Columns: Status
- Grouping: Agent field (Frontend, Testing, QA, Documentation)
- Filter: `Lifecycle:Active`

**Use Case**: See which specialized agents are working on what, identify coordination opportunities

#### 5. Icebox View (Idea Capture)

**Purpose**: Low-friction storage for raw ideas

**Configuration**:

- Layout: Table or Board
- Filter: `Lifecycle:Icebox`

**Use Case**: Capture ideas without full requirements, periodic triage to promote to Backlog

### Lifecycle Workflow

The **Lifecycle** field tracks idea maturity from conception to completion:

```text
Icebox ‚Üí Backlog ‚Üí Active ‚Üí Done
```

**Icebox** üßä:

- **Purpose**: Capture raw ideas with minimal friction
- **Requirements**: Title + brief description (optional labels)
- **Triage**: Periodic review to promote promising ideas to Backlog
- **Example**: "Explore dark mode implementation"

**Backlog** üìã:

- **Purpose**: Well-defined issues ready for prioritization
- **Requirements**: Full description + priority + complexity + category labels
- **Selection**: Reviewed when selecting next work
- **Example**: "Implement dark mode toggle with system preference detection"

**Active** ‚ö°:

- **Purpose**: Current work (1-2 issues) or next up (high priority)
- **WIP Limit**: Typically 1-2 issues maximum
- **Visibility**: Appears in Board, Backlog, Quick Wins, and Agent Workload views
- **Example**: Currently implementing dark mode toggle

**Done** ‚úÖ:

- **Purpose**: Completed and deployed
- **Automation**: Auto-set when PR merged and issue closed
- **Archival**: Automatically archived after completion

### Automation

**Auto-Add Issues**:

- All new issues automatically added to project
- Ensures no issues are missed
- Default Lifecycle: `Backlog` (or `Icebox` if no priority label)

**Status Automation**:

- PR merged ‚Üí Status: `Done`
- Issue closed ‚Üí Status: `Done`, Lifecycle: `Done`
- Reduces manual field updates

**Auto-Archive**:

- Issues with `Lifecycle:Done` automatically archived after 30 days
- Keeps active views focused on current work

### Integration with Labels

**Labels remain the primary source of truth**:

- Priority labels (priority-1-critical through priority-4-low)
- Complexity labels (complexity-minimal through complexity-epic)
- Category labels (category-feature, category-infrastructure, etc.)

**Projects provides visual layer**:

- Custom fields mirror label values for filtering/sorting
- Status and Lifecycle fields add workflow tracking
- Views provide different perspectives on labeled issues

**Workflow**:

1. Create issue with labels (via `gh issue create` or web UI)
2. Issue auto-added to project with fields populated from labels
3. Manually set Lifecycle (Icebox/Backlog/Active) based on readiness
4. Use Board view to move through Status stages
5. PR merge auto-updates Status and Lifecycle to Done

### CLI Integration

GitHub CLI supports project management via `gh project` commands:

```bash
# List projects
gh project list --owner @me

# View project items
gh project item-list PROJECT_NUMBER

# Add issue to project (usually automated)
gh project item-add PROJECT_NUMBER --owner OWNER --url ISSUE_URL

# Update field value
gh project item-edit --project-id PROJECT_ID --field-id FIELD_ID --value "In Progress"
```

**Note**: Most operations are done via web UI for better UX. CLI is available for automation and bulk operations.

### Best Practices

**Daily Workflow**:

1. Start day by checking Board view for In Progress items
2. Move items through Status as work progresses
3. When work completes, use Backlog view to select next issue
4. Check Quick Wins view for momentum opportunities

**Weekly Activities**:

1. Review Icebox view to triage new ideas
2. Promote ready ideas to Backlog with proper labels
3. Update priorities in Backlog based on changing needs
4. Archive or close stale Icebox items

**Issue Creation**:

- Well-defined issues ‚Üí Create with labels ‚Üí Auto-adds to Backlog
- Raw ideas ‚Üí Create without labels ‚Üí Manually set Lifecycle:Icebox
- Urgent work ‚Üí Create with priority-1-critical ‚Üí Manually set Lifecycle:Active

## Documentation and Knowledge Management

### Project Knowledge

- **ADR Integration**: Link major decisions to project management
- **Issue Documentation**: Comprehensive issue descriptions and updates
- **Process Documentation**: Keep management processes current
- **Learning Capture**: Document lessons learned and best practices

### Communication

- **Status Updates**: Regular progress communication
- **Stakeholder Updates**: Keep stakeholders informed of progress
