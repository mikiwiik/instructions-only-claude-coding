# Project Management and Issue Tracking

This document outlines the project management practices, issue tracking workflow, and planning methodologies
used in the Todo App project.

## Project Management Overview

The Todo App uses GitHub Issues for feature tracking and follows a structured development approach designed
to demonstrate professional project management practices while supporting the educational objectives of Claude
Code collaboration.

### Core Principles

- **Issue-Driven Development**: All features begin with detailed GitHub issues
- **Architectural Documentation**: Major decisions documented as ADRs in `docs/adr/`
- **Test-Driven Development**: TDD methodology for all feature implementation
- **Quality Assurance**: Pre-commit hooks ensure code quality with automatic linting and formatting
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Claude Code assistance integrated throughout development workflow

## Priority System

The project uses a standardized priority labeling system for effective issue management and resource allocation.

### Priority Labels

- **priority-1-critical** üî¥: Blocking issues, security vulnerabilities, broken core functionality
- **priority-2-high** üü†: Important features, significant improvements, major bugs
- **priority-3-medium** üü°: Standard features, minor improvements, non-critical bugs
- **priority-4-low** üü¢: Nice-to-have features, documentation updates, minor enhancements

### Priority-Based Development Workflow

Development efforts are prioritized based on issue labels:

1. **Critical Priority** üî¥: Immediate attention, stop other work
   - Security vulnerabilities requiring immediate patches
   - Blocking bugs that prevent core functionality
   - Infrastructure issues affecting development workflow

2. **High Priority** üü†: Primary development focus for current sprint
   - Major features that significantly enhance user experience
   - Important architectural improvements
   - Critical bug fixes for released features

3. **Medium Priority** üü°: Standard workflow, next sprint scheduling
   - Standard feature development
   - Performance improvements
   - Non-critical bug fixes and enhancements

4. **Low Priority** üü¢: Backlog items, learning opportunities
   - Nice-to-have features for future consideration
   - Documentation improvements and updates
   - Learning experiments and exploration tasks

### Priority Assessment Criteria

When assigning priority labels, consider:

- **User Impact**: How many users are affected by this issue?
- **Business Value**: What value does this provide to the project goals?
- **Technical Risk**: What are the risks of not addressing this issue?
- **Dependencies**: Does this block other work or features?
- **Effort vs. Value**: What is the return on investment for this work?

## Complexity-Based Effort Estimation

The project uses complexity labels to enable accurate effort estimation in Claude Code development, replacing
traditional time-based estimates with cognitive load assessment.

### Complexity Labels

- **complexity-minimal** üü¢: Single file changes, quick fixes, documentation updates
- **complexity-simple** üîµ: Basic features, straightforward logic, standard patterns
- **complexity-moderate** üü°: Multi-component changes, state management, integration work
- **complexity-complex** üü†: Architecture changes, system design, comprehensive testing
- **complexity-epic** üî¥: Major overhauls, breaking changes, foundational work

### Complexity Assessment Guidelines

#### Minimal Complexity üü¢

- **Scope**: Single file modifications
- **Examples**: Documentation updates, simple bug fixes, configuration changes
- **Typical Tasks**: Text changes, comment additions, single line fixes
- **Considerations**: No architectural impact, minimal testing required

#### Simple Complexity üîµ

- **Scope**: Basic feature additions with straightforward logic
- **Examples**: New UI components, simple data transformations, basic validations
- **Typical Tasks**: Single component features, standard patterns
- **Considerations**: Well-understood requirements, minimal dependencies

#### Moderate Complexity üü°

- **Scope**: Multi-component changes requiring coordination
- **Examples**: State management updates, feature integration, cross-component functionality
- **Typical Tasks**: Complex UI interactions, data flow modifications
- **Considerations**: Multiple file changes, integration testing required

#### Complex Complexity üü†

- **Scope**: Architectural changes affecting system design
- **Examples**: New technology adoption, major refactoring, performance optimization
- **Typical Tasks**: Framework changes, design pattern implementation
- **Considerations**: Significant testing, documentation, and review requirements

#### Epic Complexity üî¥

- **Scope**: Major overhauls requiring fundamental changes
- **Examples**: Complete rewrites, breaking changes, foundational infrastructure
- **Typical Tasks**: System-wide changes, major version updates
- **Considerations**: Extensive planning, phased implementation, comprehensive testing

## Combined Planning Approach

Issues are labeled with both priority and complexity for optimal development planning and resource allocation.

### Planning Matrix

- **High Priority + Low Complexity** üü†üü¢: Quick wins and urgent fixes
  - Immediate implementation for maximum impact
  - Perfect for filling small time gaps
  - Build momentum with visible progress

- **High Priority + High Complexity** üü†üî¥: Major features requiring careful planning
  - Requires detailed planning and architecture consideration
  - May need breaking into smaller issues
  - Allocate dedicated focused time

- **Low Priority + Low Complexity** üü¢üü¢: Good filler work and maintenance tasks
  - Excellent for learning and experimentation
  - Can be completed when waiting for other work
  - Good for new contributors or skill development

- **Low Priority + High Complexity** üü¢üî¥: Learning opportunities and future preparation
  - Research and exploration tasks
  - Technology evaluation and prototyping
  - Long-term strategic improvements

## Claude-Workflow Label Integration

### AI Collaboration Issue Management

The project includes specialized tracking for AI collaboration and Claude Code workflow improvements through
the `claude-workflow` label.

**üìã Full Guidelines**: See [`docs/guidelines/claude-workflow-labels.md`](../guidelines/claude-workflow-labels.md)
for comprehensive claude-workflow label usage and integration guidelines.

#### When to Use claude-workflow Label

**‚úÖ Use for AI-related issues:**

- Claude Code usage and instruction improvements
- AI collaboration patterns and methodologies
- CLAUDE.md documentation and requirements
- Task planning protocols for agentic coding
- Issue creation and labeling processes for AI development
- Documentation consistency across AI-assisted development

**‚ùå Standard development issues:**

- General git/CI/CD workflow (use standard labels)
- Feature implementations (focus on functionality)
- UI/UX improvements (unless AI interaction specific)
- Infrastructure changes (unless Claude Code related)

#### Combined Label Patterns

**Critical AI Workflow Issues:**

```bash
--label "claude-workflow,priority-1-critical,complexity-simple"
```

**AI Documentation and Guidelines:**

```bash
--label "claude-workflow,documentation,priority-2-high,complexity-simple"
```

**AI Process Improvements:**

```bash
--label "claude-workflow,process-improvement,priority-2-high,complexity-moderate"
```

#### Integration Benefits

- **Clear AI Focus**: Easy identification of AI collaboration improvements
- **Methodology Tracking**: Monitor agentic coding workflow evolution
