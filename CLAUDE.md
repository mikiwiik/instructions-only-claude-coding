# Claude Code Instructions

This file contains specific instructions for Claude Code when working on this Todo App project.

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: All major architectural changes and decisions MUST be documented as ADRs.

**ðŸ“‹ Process Documentation**: See [`docs/adr/PROCESS.md`](docs/adr/PROCESS.md) for complete ADR requirements and guidelines.

### Quick Reference
- **When**: Before any significant technical decision
- **Where**: `docs/adr/###-title.md` using the template
- **What**: Technology choices, architecture patterns, development practices
- **Why**: Maintain project knowledge and decision rationale

### Key Requirements
1. **Create ADR before implementation** - not after
2. **Use sequential numbering** - next available number
3. **Document alternatives considered** - show the thinking process
4. **Update ADR index** - maintain `docs/adr/README.md`
5. **Reference in commits** - link ADRs to related code changes

## Development Guidelines

### Testing Requirements

- **TDD Approach**: Write tests first, then implementation
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for comprehensive coverage of core functionality
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for logic, integration tests for user workflows

### Code Quality

- **TypeScript**: Use strict typing, avoid `any` types
- **ESLint**: Follow established linting rules
- **Prettier**: Maintain consistent code formatting
- **Comments**: Document complex logic and architectural decisions

### Commit Practices

- **Clear messages**: Describe what and why, not just what
- **Reference issues**: Link commits to GitHub issues when applicable
- **ADR updates**: Include ADR updates in relevant commits
- **Issue closure**: Use "Closes #X" or "Fixes #X" in commit messages to automatically close GitHub issues
- **Atomic commits**: Each commit should represent a complete, logical change
- **Co-author attribution**: Always include Claude Code co-authorship in commits

## Current Architecture Decisions

Refer to existing ADRs in `docs/adr/` for current architectural decisions:

1. **Next.js 14 + App Router** - Web framework choice
2. **TypeScript** - Type safety and developer experience
3. **Tailwind CSS** - Styling approach
4. **Test-Driven Development** - Development methodology
5. **localStorage** - Data persistence strategy
6. **React Testing Library + Jest** - Testing framework
7. **Custom React Hooks** - State management approach
8. **GitHub Issues** - Project management workflow

## Prompt Logging

All Claude Code interactions are logged in `claude-prompts.log` for reference and learning purposes.

**Remember**: When in doubt about architectural decisions, create an ADR to document the thought process and decision rationale. This maintains project knowledge and helps future development.
