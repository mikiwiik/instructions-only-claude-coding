# Todo App - My First Claude Code Project

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/mikiwiik/my-first-claude-code/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mikiwiik/my-first-claude-code/actions/workflows/build.yml)

**üåê Live Demo**: [Todo App on Vercel](https://my-first-claude-code-fhhkrlt3f-miki-wiiks-projects.vercel.app/)

## Project Purpose

This Todo application serves as a **learning platform** for Claude Code development workflows and modern web development practices. The primary goal is to demonstrate AI-assisted coding, TDD methodology, and collaborative development patterns.

### Learning Objectives

- **Claude Code Collaboration**: Explore AI-assisted development workflows and best practices
- **Test-Driven Development**: Learn TDD methodology with comprehensive testing strategies
- **Modern Web Stack**: Practice with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- **Architectural Documentation**: Use ADRs to document technical decisions
- **GitHub Issues Workflow**: Experience issue-driven development and project management

### Educational Focus

This is a **learning project** designed to showcase:

- How to effectively collaborate with Claude Code
- Best practices for AI-assisted software development
- Structured approach to building applications with proper documentation
- Integration of testing, linting, and quality assurance tools

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.x or higher
- npm 10.x or higher
- Claude Code Pro subscription ([setup guide](docs/setup/installation.md))

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/mikiwiik/my-first-claude-code.git
cd my-first-claude-code
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application.

### Available Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Create production build
npm run test         # Run test suite
npm run lint         # Run code linting
npm run type-check   # TypeScript type checking
```

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Development**: Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- **Deployment**: Vercel with GitHub Actions CI/CD

## Development Status

**Current Workflow**: Branch-based development with pull requests

- Features developed on separate branches (`feature/issue-number-description`)
- Pull requests used for code review and CI validation
- Main branch maintains stable, tested code
- Automatic deployment to production after successful CI

## Contributing

### Getting Started

1. **Review Documentation**: Start with the [installation guide](docs/setup/installation.md)
2. **Understand Workflow**: Read the [development workflow](docs/development/workflow.md)
3. **Check Issues**: Browse [GitHub issues](https://github.com/mikiwiik/my-first-claude-code/issues) for tasks
4. **Follow Standards**: Adhere to project [coding standards](docs/development/workflow.md)

### Development Process

1. **Create Branch**: `feature/issue-number-description`
2. **Follow TDD**: Write tests first, then implementation
3. **Maintain Quality**: Pre-commit hooks ensure code quality
4. **Create PR**: Submit pull request for review
5. **CI Validation**: Ensure all checks pass before merge

### Issue Management

The project uses GitHub Issues with priority and complexity labels:

- **Priority**: `priority-1-critical` üî¥ to `priority-4-low` üü¢
- **Complexity**: `complexity-minimal` üü¢ to `complexity-epic` üî¥

See [project management guide](docs/development/project-management.md) for detailed workflows.

## Features
