# ü§ñ Agentic Coding Prototype - Complete Software Development Through AI Instruction

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/mikiwiik/instructions-only-claude-coding/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mikiwiik/instructions-only-claude-coding/actions/workflows/build.yml)

**üåê Live Demo**: [Todo App on Vercel](https://instructions-only-claude-coding.vercel.app/)

## Project Purpose

**This project demonstrates groundbreaking agentic coding methodology** - building complete, production-ready software
through pure instruction-based collaboration with Claude Code. This Todo application showcases how complex applications
can be developed with **zero manual coding**, where the human acts as architect/product manager and AI handles all
implementation.

### Core Innovation: Instruction-Only Development

This project proves that sophisticated software can be built entirely through strategic instruction rather than
traditional hand-coding. The methodology demonstrates:

- **Pure AI Implementation**: 100% AI-generated codebase following professional development practices
- **Role-Based Collaboration**: Human provides strategic direction, AI executes technical implementation
- **Complete Development Lifecycle**: From initial planning to production deployment via instruction
- **Enterprise-Quality Standards**: TDD, atomic commits, CI/CD, and architectural documentation maintained through AI instruction

## Agentic Development Methodology

### Role-Based Interaction Patterns

#### Human Role: Strategic Architect & Product Owner

- Defines requirements, features, and acceptance criteria
- Sets architectural direction and technical constraints
- Provides feedback on implementation and user experience
- Makes product decisions and priority calls

#### AI Role: Complete Implementation Team

- Writes all code following TDD methodology
- Implements testing strategies and maintains test coverage
- Handles CI/CD pipeline configuration and deployment
- Creates comprehensive documentation and ADRs
- Manages code quality, linting, and type safety

### Instruction-Based Development Process

1. **Strategic Planning**: Human provides high-level feature requirements
2. **Technical Planning**: AI breaks down into implementation tasks with TodoWrite
3. **Test-Driven Implementation**: AI writes tests first, then implementation
4. **Quality Assurance**: AI runs all validation, testing, and quality checks
5. **Documentation**: AI maintains comprehensive project documentation
6. **Deployment**: AI handles production deployment through instruction

### Measurable Outcomes

- **100% AI-Generated Codebase**: Every line of code written by Claude Code
- **Professional Development Practices**: TDD, atomic commits, CI/CD maintained throughout
- **Complex Feature Implementation**: Advanced functionality (drag-and-drop, accessibility, responsive design) built via
  instruction
- **Production-Ready Quality**: Live deployment with full testing and quality assurance

### Learning Objectives

- **Agentic Coding Mastery**: Learn effective AI instruction patterns for complex software development
- **Role Separation Strategy**: Understand optimal human-AI collaboration for maximum productivity
- **Instruction-Based Architecture**: Experience building sophisticated applications through strategic direction
- **Quality Through AI**: Maintain enterprise standards using AI-driven development practices
- **Scalable Methodology**: Develop repeatable patterns for instruction-based software development

### Educational Impact

This project serves as a **template and reference** for:

- **Effective AI Instruction Techniques**: Proven patterns for complex software development
- **Agentic Workflow Design**: Role separation strategies for optimal human-AI collaboration
- **Quality Assurance Through AI**: Maintaining professional standards in AI-generated code
- **Innovation in Software Development**: Pushing boundaries of what's possible with current AI capabilities

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.x or higher
- npm 10.x or higher
- Claude Code Pro subscription ([setup guide](docs/setup/installation.md))

### Authentication Setup

Claude Code supports two authentication methods for API access:

#### API Key Authentication (Recommended for Long Sessions)

- Prevents OAuth token expiration during extended development sessions
- No interruptions from 401 authentication errors
- Ideal for continuous workflow

**Configuration Steps:**

1. Visit [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Navigate to Claude Code section on main page
3. Click "Create API key"
4. Add `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"` to `~/.zprofile` (or `~/.bashrc` for bash), replacing
   `your_api_key_here` with your actual API key
5. Run `/logout` in Claude Code to switch to API key authentication
6. Restart your terminal or run `source ~/.zprofile`

#### OAuth Authentication

- Quick setup for shorter sessions
- May require re-authentication every few hours
- Can cause 401 errors during long coding sessions

#### Troubleshooting 401 Authentication Errors

If you encounter 401 authentication errors during development:

1. Switch to API key authentication (recommended for long sessions)
2. Or re-authenticate with OAuth in Claude Code settings
3. Verify your API key/token has necessary permissions
4. Check token expiration in Anthropic Console

For detailed authentication documentation, see [Claude Code Authentication Guide](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/).

### Installation
