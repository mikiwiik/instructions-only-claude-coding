    # Versioning strategy for pinned dependencies
    # Updates exact versions (e.g., "1.2.3" -> "1.3.0")
    # Aligns with project's pinned dependency policy (CLAUDE.md #11)
    versioning-strategy: increase

    # Limit open PRs to prevent review queue overflow
    # Security updates bypass this limit (always immediate)
    open-pull-requests-limit: 5

    # Group minor and patch updates to reduce PR volume
    # Major updates remain separate for careful review
    groups:
      # React ecosystem packages must update together
      # Ensures react, react-dom, and their types stay in sync
      # Especially critical for major version updates (e.g., React 19)

        patterns:
          - "react"
          - "react-dom"

    # Commit message configuration (conventional commits)
    # Aligns with project commit message conventions
    # Note: Do NOT use "include: scope" - it duplicates the scope already in the prefix

      prefix: "build(deps)"

    # Ignore rules to prevent incompatible upgrades
    # React 19 requires Next.js 15+ due to peer dependency constraints
    # See ADR: React/Next.js Version Dependency Constraints
    # Upgrade path: Next.js 14 → Next.js 15, then React 18 → React 19
    # Related issues: #232, #191, #223
    ignore:
      # Prevent React major version upgrades until Next.js is compatible
      # React 19+ requires Next.js 15+ (current: Next.js 14.2.33)
