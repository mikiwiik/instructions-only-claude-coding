    # Versioning strategy for pinned dependencies

    # Aligns with project's pinned dependency policy (CLAUDE.md #11)

    # Security updates bypass this limit (always immediate)

    # Major updates remain separate for careful review
    groups:
      # React ecosystem packages must update together
